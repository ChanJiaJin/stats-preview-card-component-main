## My process ###

1) Study the sample site and plan out the initial HTML layout
2) Write in HTML layout while deciding to use either CSS grid or Flexbox and structure them accordingly
3) Set up flexbox in accordance to flow of the contents
4) Set up grid to give stats a more structured layout for my convinience
5) Adjust elements' margins/paddings to make them look as close as the original
6) Add in background colours and font/image colours through the use of CSS variables
7) Changed all fonts to the required fonts as stated in the design README
8) Edited atribution line to have my name and remove text decorations

### Built with ###

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned ###

This is my second project from frontend mentor. Through this challenge, I am able to further my understanding about the use and limitations of flexbox and grid.The challenge has taught me how to carefully choose the best tool to use depending on the situation and how to rearrange the orders of the contents to produce the mobile view.


### Continued development ###

One area I will like to continue to focus on in future projects is to be able to further deepen my understanding of CSS. Through this challenge, I saw for myself that the path to mastering CSS is not an easy one. Doing things like giving a coloured overlay to an image has given me many issues during the build and commonly used solutions provided by people online has yet to worked. I realised that there are many solutions to similingly similar problems, and it is up to me to identify which is the solution most apt to my situation.

### Useful resources ###
